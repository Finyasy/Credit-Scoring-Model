# Credit-Scoring-Model
A credit scoring model is a mathematical model used to estimate the probability of default, which is the probability that customers may trigger a credit event (i.e. bankruptcy, obligation default, failure to pay, and cross-default events). In a credit scoring model, the probability of default is normally presented in the form of a credit score.
